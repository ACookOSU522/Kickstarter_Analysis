## Analysis and Challenges
### Outcomes by date ![/assets/images/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png]

###  Outcomes by goal ![/assets/images/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png]

### Challenges/Difficulties:
*Challenge of charting goal outcomes due to function application frustrations. As that hurdle was overcome other pieces were swiftly corrected to obtain a clean chart.

## Results: 
_Conclusions of Outcome by Date:_
*Most successful March-May with peak success April/May. Suggesting early spring is peak campaign launch time. 
*High failure rate in October, would not recommend starting a campaign in fall.

_Conclusions of Outcome by Goal:_
*Most successful campaign goal in dual points, in $1,000-4,999 range and in $40,000-44,999 range. Smaller budget	performances, and upper-middle budget performances appear to be best at gathering donations for future play projects.  

_Limitations on data set:_
*Limitations derived from telescoping into Theater/Play specific data. I suggest consideration for opening research into Theater as a general guide, and fine tuning script/casting to match.
		

_Other possible tables/graphs to create:_
* Recommended: A deeper study of countries for higher investors in general arts, and additionally to see if data on weather patterns has any effect on campaign success.
