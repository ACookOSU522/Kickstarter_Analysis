## Analysis of Theater Crowdfunding Campaigns
### To establish the most successful launch for a crowdfund campaign for new Theatrical Play production based on launch date and funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges
Ascertaining how different play campaigns succeeded or failed in relation to launch dates and funding goals. Then I created charts for outcomes based on data provided as a visual summary. Recorded findings and suggestions for best possible outcome of future theatrical campaign funding. 

### Outcomes by date ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106544424/173691145-7ba1ee5d-d0f4-492f-8f95-03dbfcdc679e.png)

###  Outcomes by goal![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/106544424/174191644-33b58742-d6d4-45b8-9530-43677c8a0df7.png)

### Challenges/Difficulties:
* Challenge of charting goal outcomes due to function application frustrations. As that hurdle was overcome other dataset pieces were swiftly corrected to obtain clean visuals.

## Results: 
_Conclusions of Outcome by Date:_
* Most successful March-May with peak success April/May. Suggesting early spring is peak campaign launch time. 
* High failure rate in October, would not recommend starting a campaign in fall.

_Conclusions of Outcome by Goal:_
* Most successful campaign goal in dual points, in $5,000-9,999 range and in $25,000-29,000 range. Small-mid budget performances, and middle budget performances appear to be best at gathering donations for future play projects.  

_Limitations on data set:_
* Limitations derived from telescoping into Theater/Play specific data. I suggest consideration for opening research into Theater as a general guide, and fine tuning script/casting to match.
		

_Other possible tables/graphs to create:_
* Recommended: A deeper study of countries for higher investors in general arts, and additionally to see if data on weather patterns has any effect on campaign success.
